<h1 align="center">EarlyGame</h1>
<p align="center">A 1.16.2 Fabric mod focusing on changing early game aspects to make the game feel more "realistic". This mod is currently in the very early alpha state so expect incomplete features.</p>

## Background
This idea revolves around the fact that as of this writing, no such mods for early game realism are present in the Fabric mod database. Then I thought, "Fine, I'll do it myself." Moreover, it was inspired by two particular Forge mods that have the same premise, namely [No Tree Punching (1.12.2/1.15.2)](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/no-tree-punching) and [Natural Progression (1.14.4/1.15.2)](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/natural-progressions).

## Features
### Current
- Removed the most beloved early game feature: punching trees.
- Along with this, stone and wood materials cannot be broken without a proper tool.
- Rocks and sticks are scattered around the world to help you progress.
- Andesite, granite and diorite rock and cobblestone variants complement with stone variants.
- You cannot craft wooden and stone tools.
- Vanilla crafting for planks and sticks are also disabled.
- Flint can be knapped on the stone surface to create flint shards.
- Flint shards can then be crafted into makeshift tools such as a knife, pickaxe, axe, and saw.
- There's a new mineral: copper!
- Copper tools are tiered exactly with stone tools to make it useful for those who use stone tools a lot.
- Copper armor can be crafted for a small but right amount of protection.
- New tools are introduced as well: saws and knives!
### In consideration
- Taking damage from breaking wooden and stone materials with bare hands
- Rock generation underwater

## Dependencies
- **Fabric API** (0.20.1 build 401-1.16 and above)

## Issues
All incompatibilities and bugs can be reported in the [issues](https://github.com/JayCeeCreates/earlygame/issues) section.

## Credits
- **BoogieMonster1O1** (a great help for the code)
- **You** (for playing with this mod!)

### Any plans for a Forge version?
A Forge version of this particular mod is not necessary. I recommend the two aforementioned mods if you want to play an early game mod on Forge.
