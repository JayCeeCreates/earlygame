<h4 align="center">A Fabric mod that focuses on changing early game progression that makes the gameplay feel more "realistic".</h4>

## Background

This idea revolves around the fact that as of this writing, no such mods for early game realism are present in the Fabric mod database. Then I thought, "Fine, I'll do it myself." Moreover, it was inspired by two particular Forge mods that have the same premise, namely [No Tree Punching](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/no-tree-punching) and [Natural Progression](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/natural-progressions).

## Features

- Disables the ability to get wood from punching trees
- Proper tools are required to collect stone and wood
- Chopping logs to make planks, and planks to sticks
- Rocks and sticks are naturally generated around the world
- Cobblestone variants
- Makeshift flint tools
- Copper items, tools and armor
- Knives and saws serving as alternatives

More details are in the [wiki](https://jayceecreates.github.io/earlygame/wiki).
