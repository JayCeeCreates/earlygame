<h2>Overview</h2>

<div class="my-4">
    <p>If you're familiar with the gameplay of <b>No Tree Punching</b> and/or <b>Natural Progression</b>, then
        this mod has some similar aspects to it. Here's a comprehensive overview of what EarlyGame has to offer.
        All controls in this section use the default controls. Footage taken from Minecraft 1.19.</p>
    
    <h3>Sticks and stones everywhere</h3>
    <p>You spawn in the new world, and you immediately see a lot of sticks and rocks around you. They naturally
        spawn on the surface as the world is being generated. You can use them to your advantage.</p>

    <h3>From flint to makeshift</h3>
    <p>After getting flint from gravel, press the <b><i class="fa-solid fa-computer-mouse"></i> RMB</b> button
        on top of any stone block to knap it, turning them to flint shards which can be used to craft makeshift
        tools. Oh, and new tools are introduced (i.e. knives and saws). You can make more shards by
        pressing <b><i class="fa-solid fa-keyboard"></i> Shift + <i class="fa-solid fa-computer-mouse"></i> RMB</b>
        with a knife on a small block of rock. The crafting guide can be found on the <b><u>Recipes</u></b>
        section of the wiki.</p>

    <h3>The right tools for the right job</h3>
    <p>EarlyGame removes the most important game mechanic of Minecraft: punching wood. You accumulate damage as
        you continue trying to break it, so best craft a proper tool to get the job done. An axe for breaking wood,
        a pickaxe for breaking stones, etc. Of course, you wouldn't be dumb enough to keep punching stone, would ya?</p>

    <h3>A new way to woodwork</h3>
    <p>EarlyGame also removes some crafting recipes related to planks and sticks. You don't have to craft a wooden
        log into four planks. Grab an axe or a saw and press <b><i class="fa-solid fa-keyboard"></i>
        Shift + <i class="fa-solid fa-computer-mouse"></i> RMB</b> on the top of the log to convert them into
        wooden planks, and the wooden planks into sticks. Cutting wood with an axe yields you 2-4 wooden planks
        and 1-2 sticks respectively, and by using a saw, a maximum amount is yielded.
    </p>
    
    <h3>Copper tools! (...and armor)</h3>
    <p>
        Wooden and stone tools are disabled by default, which brings us to copper tools. These tools are tiered exactly
        with stone tools, so they would feel like they actually have a use in early game other than just a substitute
        for iron. Copper armor is also available, durable enough to be an early game armor.
    </p>
    
    <h3>You are in control</h3>
    <p>
        Some values of the mod are configurable. From making ground blocks slower to dig to the chance of taking damage
        from punching wood, either you make your experience basic or literally virtually impossible. It's all up to you.
        You can find these values in the <b>config &gt; earlygame.json</b> file in the game directory, or download
        <b>Mod Menu</b> to configure the values in-game. Hover your mouse over the setting and a tooltip will appear
        which describes the setting you are about to modify.
